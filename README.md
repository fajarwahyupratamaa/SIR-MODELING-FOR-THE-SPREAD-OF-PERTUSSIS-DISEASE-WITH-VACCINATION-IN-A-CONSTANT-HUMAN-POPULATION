# SIR-MODELING-FOR-THE-SPREAD-OF-PERTUSSIS-DISEASE-WITH-VACCINATION-IN-A-CONSTANT-HUMAN-POPULATION
This research deals with mathematical modeling of pertussis disease that has been experienced by several people, and became an epidemic several years ago. According to research by Hu et al. (2012), namely in his research considering continuous time models of the SIRS type, the epidemic is explained by differential equations. This mathematical modeling is expected to be able to interpret and predict the spread of pertussis disease and its handling steps in the form of vaccination.
